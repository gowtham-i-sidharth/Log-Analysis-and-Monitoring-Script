## Overview

This script automates the analysis and monitoring of log files. It continuously monitors a specified log file for new entries in real-time and performs basic analysis on log entries.

## Requirements

- Bash shell environment.
- Access to the log file you want to monitor and analyze.

## Usage

1. **Transfer the script to your server**:
   - Use `scp` to transfer the script to your server. Example:
     ```
     scp -i your_key.pem your_script.sh ec2-user@your_server_ip:/path/to/destination
     ```

2. **SSH into your server**:
   - Connect to your server using SSH. Example:
     ```
     ssh -i your_key.pem ec2-user@your_server_ip
     ```

3. **Navigate to the script directory**:
   - Once connected to your server, navigate to the directory where you transferred the script.

4. **Make the script executable**:
   - If needed, make the script executable using:
     ```
     chmod +x your_script.sh
     ```

5. **Run the script**:
   - Execute the script using:
     ```
     ./your_script.sh
     ```

6. **Monitor script output**:
   - Keep an eye on the terminal window where you executed the script. It will display the output of the script, including log file monitoring and analysis results.

7. **Check script execution**:
   - Depending on the script's functionality, check log files or other output locations specified by the script to verify its execution and any generated reports.

8. **Terminate the script**:
   - Once done, terminate the script using `Ctrl+C`. Remember to terminate the server instance if it's no longer needed.

## Script Details

- `your_script.sh`: Replace with the name of your script file.
- `your_key.pem`: Replace with your private key file for SSH authentication.
- `your_server_ip`: Replace with the public IP address or hostname of your server.
- `/path/to/destination`: Replace with the destination directory on your server where the script file will be copied.
